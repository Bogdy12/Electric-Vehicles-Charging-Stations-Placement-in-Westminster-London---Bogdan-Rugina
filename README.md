# Electric-Vehicles-Charging-Stations-Placement-in-Westminster-London---Bogdan-Rugina
This research takes inspiration from a previous study at the University of Freiburg, in which Wagner et al (2014) experimented with a decision support tool for optimal placement of new charging stations across Amsterdam, Netherlands. In line with this approach, a multiple linear regression model is proposed to find possible influences in charging stationsâ€™ utilization due to the proximity of different points of interest (POIs).
